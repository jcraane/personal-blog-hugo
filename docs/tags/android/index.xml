      <description>KMM adoption strategies Introduction Kotlin multiplatform Mobile, in short KMM, lets you write native cross platform mobile applications. It lets you share logic across iOS and Android while still leveraging all of the native features of the platform.
There are several advantages of sharing code between platforms:
 Reduced development time More consistent logic across platforms More consistent behavior across platforms Less bugs Improved team communication  KMM gives the flexibility to decide what code is shared.</description>

      <description>Introduction Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (in short KMM) allows you to share a lot of code which is normally duplicated across iOS and Android native platforms. KMM does not mandate that certain type of code is shared, it is up to you. It also does not mandate any particular architecture.
Although KMM enables sharing of code between platforms it does not provide the ability to share localized string resources and images out-of-the box between iOS and Android.</description>

      <description>Full source code can be found here: https://github.com/jcraane/android-simple-image-cast
By adding Chromecast support to media rich apps like photo- and video players, users can display content to Chromecast enabled devices. This greatly enhances the user experience of those apps.
This post demonstrates how to integrate the Chromecast SDK to add cast support for casting images. The app displays a list of publicly available images using an image carousel. When the user scrolls through those images, the images are cast to a connected receiver.</description>
