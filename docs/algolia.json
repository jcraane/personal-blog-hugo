My interest in GA came when I first heard about the JGAP project. As mentioned on the project\u0026rsquo;s site \u0026ldquo;JGAP (pronounced \u0026ldquo;jay-gap\u0026rdquo;) is a Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming component provided as a Java framework.\u0026rdquo;. For a newcomer I found it difficult to get a good overview about all the concepts introduced in genetic algorithms. Before diving into JGAP, I think it is essential that these concepts are well understood.","tags":["Machine learning"],"title":"Introduction to genetic algorithms","type":"post","url":"/2009/02/23/ga_introduction/","weight":0,"wordcount":2566},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"search/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8946788897930c0c0c39fbfcd30ff2e4","permalink":"https://jamiecraane.dev/search/placeholder/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/search/placeholder/","section":"search","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"search","url":"/search/placeholder/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"top/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7a0da914bde98a7d3fcc7f6c5886633c","permalink":"https://jamiecraane.dev/top/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/top/about/","section":"top","summary":"I have been developing software professionally since 2001.
