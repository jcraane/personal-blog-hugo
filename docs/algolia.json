One of those techniques is genetic algorithms. Because the diversity of melodies over a specific range of notes is so large, genetic algorithms are a good candidate to help in composing melodies. This article describes how genetic algorithms can be used to compose musical melodies. this is explained following the steps needed to apply a genetic algorithm.
